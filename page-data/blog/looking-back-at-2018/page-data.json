I learnt how to hookup a different state management libraries with React such as Redux and Apollo Client. All of this was not just theoretical and I am in process of making a full fledged side project which will actually have a purpose.</p>\n<h3 id=\"completed-a-side-project-and-deployed-to-production\"><a href=\"#completed-a-side-project-and-deployed-to-production\" aria-label=\"completed a side project and deployed to production permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Completed a side project and deployed to production</h3>\n<p>It was the year when I completed a fairly complex application and deployed it to production all by myself. </p>\n<p>I created a website <a href=\"https://bitcoincharts.in\">bitcoincharts.in</a> which was well-received by the community and the number of visitors grew pretty rapidly. The main aim of this website was to show crypto-currency prices from all different exchanges in India and compare them in graphs. </p>\n<p>Though the hype was short lived and people lost interest in crypto-currencies as soon as they started to plunge, the project taught me things which make me a better developer now.</p>\n<p>I used node.js in back-end and Redis as an in-memory database. Used websockets for connection between the front-end and back-end. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Learnt how a small piece of code can be a bottleneck and make you restart your server. </li>\n<li>Learnt about the importance of code testing and why its important to not ship broken code when you have 100+ users live on the website.</li>\n<li>Learnt about different CI/CD tools and the power of git hooks!</li>\n<li>Learnt how to deploy a node.js app in production with multiple instances.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"tried-a-whole-bunch-of-buzz-word-stuff\"><a href=\"#tried-a-whole-bunch-of-buzz-word-stuff\" aria-label=\"tried a whole bunch of buzz word stuff permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Tried a whole bunch of Buzz Word stuff</h3>\n<p>This year I tried a whole lot of stuff I heard in YouTube talks, Medium articles and Twitter.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>GraphQL</strong>: Created a nodejs back-end on top of express. This is a part of my main side-project for 2019 ;)</li>\n<li><strong>Serverless</strong>: Heard a lot about it. Then there was a contest organized by Amazon on creating an Alexa Skill. Created an Alexa skill to get flight prices using AWS Lambda as a <a href=\"https://github.com/anamritraj/flight-cards-serverless-api\">back-end</a>.  Though I did not win that contest, it was fun and I got a T-shirt so it was a win for me :)</li>\n<li>Started a <strong>YouTube Channel</strong>. Yes, I did that too :D</li>\n<li>Created an Instagram account which manages itself and is actually entertaining people without me doing anything.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-i-wanted-to-do-well-but-couldnt-do\"><a href=\"#what-i-wanted-to-do-well-but-couldnt-do\" aria-label=\"what i wanted to do well but couldnt do permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What I wanted to do well but couldn’t do?</h2>\n<p>Though I was able to accomplish a lot in 2018 somehow I feel I neglected some important stuff just because I lost interest quickly.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>General Data-structures and Algorithms</strong>: I neglected DS and Algorithms for far too long, so long that it actually cost me a great job opportunity in 2018. I am good with ‘development’ side of the work. I rely on the pre-built stuff by the community to complete my side-projects. But turns out since I am only a recent graduate, companies prefer to check my DS and Algorithmic skill rather than looking at my side projects.</li>\n<li><strong>Open Source Contributions</strong>: I put all my projects on Github and while that’s good I feel like I should’ve contributed more to some open-source projects which help me understand how to manage projects and code.</li>\n<li><strong>CI-CD (automation)</strong>: I wasted a lot of my time <strong>ssh</strong>ing into machines and running scripts. I should have just learnt how to do automated deployments!</li>\n<li><strong>Fitness</strong>: I started the year 2018 with a 6-months gym membership and but went for only 3 months or so. Later, I gained some weight during the year and decided that it’s time I do a #100DaysOfFitness challenge.</li>\n<li><strong>Social Life</strong>: Though I prefer to stay in my room for the most part, I feel I should have been socially active during 2018. I don’t spend enough time around real people. Time to change that in 2019!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"plans-for-2019\"><a href=\"#plans-for-2019\" aria-label=\"plans for 2019 permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Plans for 2019?</h2>\n<p>This is still a WIP and should be completed within a day or 2. The main focus will be DS and Algorithms, Fitness, OS contributions, Side-projects and automating a whole lot of stuff.</p>\n<p>Also, I will be more social that I was in 2019. So if you are my friend, expect a “Happy Birthday” text. Although, now that I think about it, that can be automated as well. </p>\n<p>Wait for an upcoming post that covers my plans for 2019.
